### Step 6: Mesh and SPDE Model Creation (6_Mesh_SPDE.R)
=================================

Overview:

This script builds the computational structure for spatial modeling in Switzerland.
It creates a triangular mesh and defines an **SPDE (Stochastic Partial Differential Equation)** model to represent the spatial random effect in the regression model.
The mesh + SPDE captures spatial autocorrelation between grid cells, ensuring that unmeasured geographic clustering is properly modeled in Step 7 (regression fitting).

What it does:
1. Load Swiss boundary: reproject to EPSG3035, convert to inla.sp2segment() format. 
2. Build triangulated mesh: construct mesh across Switzerland with buffer extension.
3. Define SPDE model: matern covariance function, alpha = 2.
4. Save outputs.

> Model Specification:
The mesh approximates a **Gaussian Random Field (GRF)** using the SPDE approach with a Matern covariance function.
Parameter used:
1. Mesh construction:
  - max.edge = c(20e3, 50e3) -> max triangule edge length inside vs outside boundary (20km vs 50km).
  - cutoff = 5e3 -> merge nodes within 5 km.
  - offset = c(50e3, 100e3) -> buffer outside boundary (50-100km).
2. SPDE priors:
  - prior.range = c(50e3, 0.5) -> P(range < 50km) = 0.5
  - prior.sigma = c(1, 0.01) -> P(sigma > 1) = 0.01

### Step 7: Model Fitting with inlabru (7_Model_Create.R)
=================================

Overview:

This script fits a spatial regression model to Swiss veterinary clinic data, using the inlabru/INLA framework.

It combines:
1. Poisson regression for clinic counts per 10 * 10km grid cell.
2. Fixed effects: environmental and socio-economic covariates.
3. Random effect: a Gaussian Random Field (GRF) estimated via the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach, to capture spatial autocorrelation.

What it does:
1. Load data: Swiss grid and covariates, merge datasets by cell_id; Ensure covariates are numeric, impute missing value with column means.
2. Load mesh and SPDE model: import mesh and SPDE.
3. Define inlabru components: intercept; Covariates (settlement, ca, ch, pg, sh, pop, urban, gdp, acc); SPDE random effect.
4. Fit model with bru(): Poisson (family); merged Swiss grid and covariates; cell area (exposure).
5. Save outputs.

> Model specification

The response variable (clinic counts) is modeled using a **Log-Gaussian Cox process** approximation via a Poisson likelihood:

$$
y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i \cdot A_i)
$$

where  
- \(y_i\) = observed number of clinics in grid cell *i*  
- \(\lambda_i\) = intensity (expected rate per unit area)  
- \(A_i\) = area (exposure) of grid cell *i*  

The log-intensity \(\lambda_i\) is modeled through a **log-link function** with fixed effects and a spatial random effect:

$$
\log(\lambda_i) = \beta_0 
+ \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{ip} 
+ w(s_i)
$$

where  
- \(\beta_0\) = intercept  
- \(\beta_k\) = regression coefficient for covariate \(x_{ik}\)  
- \(x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ip}\) = covariates for grid cell *i* (e.g., settlement, population density, GDP, accessibility)  
- \(w(s_i)\) = spatial random effect at location \(s_i\), modeled as a **Gaussian Random Field (GRF)** with MatÃ©rn covariance, approximated via the **SPDE mesh**

# GlobalVetMap

This project aims to develop a global map of travel time to veterinary services, with a specific focus on food animal. Previous research underrepresented data from lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and lacked detailed information on veterinary practice specialization. 

Access to veterinary care is a critical yet overlooked for food security and rural livelihoods, especially in LMICs where households often rely on food animals for income and subsistence. Long travel times to veterinary service delay the treatment and disease control, and can cause significant economic loss and risks to animal and human health.

This project will first build a comprehensive geospatial database of veterinary practices worldwide, incorporating geographical coordinates, species specialization (small animals vs. food animals), workforce demographics (disaggregated by gender and professional roles). Data will be drawn from national and subnational veterinary association, governmental agencies, yellow page or other directories, and open-source maps such as Google Maps and OpenStreetMap. Web-scraping techniques in combination with large language models are used to extract information about the specialization and team information of the practices.

The collected data is used to support the global modeling of veterinary service availability and accessibility, with a focus on food animal health capacity, and identify the coldspots of veterinary capacity in food animals, which are the places with insufficient access to food animal health care. Scenario analysis will be conducted to simulate optimal placement of new veterinary infrastructure to reduce travel time and improve service coverage with minimal resource input.
